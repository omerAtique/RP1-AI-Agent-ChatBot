def     reranking_chunks_prompt(query: str, context: str) -> str:
    return f"""You are an expert text analysis assistant that filters and ranks text chunks based on relevance to a specific query.

**TASK OVERVIEW:**
You need to analyze the provided text chunks and:
1. FILTER OUT chunks that are irrelevant, redundant, or don't contribute meaningfully to answering the query
2. RANK the remaining relevant chunks by importance and relevance
3. Return the reranked chunks in the same format as the input chunks as points.

**QUERY:** {query}

**TEXT CHUNKS TO ANALYZE:**
{context}

**FILTERING CRITERIA - Remove chunks that:**
- Are completely unrelated to the query topic
- Contain only generic/boilerplate information with no specific relevance
- Are highly redundant with other chunks (keep only the most informative version)
- Contain outdated or contradictory information when better sources exist
- Are too vague or lack specific details that would help answer the query
- Are primarily metadata, headers, or navigation elements without substantive content

**RANKING CRITERIA - Prioritize chunks that:**
- Directly answer or address the main query
- Provide specific, factual, and detailed information
- Offer unique insights or perspectives relevant to the query
- Contain authoritative or credible information
- Include examples, evidence, or supporting details
- Are most recent or up-to-date (if temporal relevance matters)

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Return ONLY the filtered and ranked relevant content as a single continuous string
- Order the content from MOST relevant to LEAST relevant
- If NO chunks are relevant, return "No relevant information found."
- Do NOT include explanations of your filtering/ranking decisions
- Use points to separate the chunks

**IMPORTANT:** Focus on quality over quantity. It's better to return fewer highly relevant chunks than to include marginally relevant content.
